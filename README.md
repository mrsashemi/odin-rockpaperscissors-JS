The Odin Project - Javascript Rock, Paper, Scissors

Fri Jan 21 5:21
Today I'm working on yet another odin project...project! This time it's a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors simply done in the console. I've been practicing quite a bit so it was actually pretty simple. I started by trying to write the solution first on paper (algorithm) before jumping straight into the code. I wrote the following:

Create a constant rochambeau array containing the strings Rock, Paper, Scissors
Create a function rockPaperScissors with input variable x where x is a string
Create a variable computerSelection that randomly selects a string from our array and makes it upper case
Create a variable playerSelection that makes the input x upper case
If playerSelection equals ROCK and computerSelection equals SCISSORS return "You win! Rock beats scissors"
Repeat else if statement for winning combinations, losing combinations, and tie
For losing combinations and replace the return string with "You lose! computerSelection beats playerSelections"
For tie return "It's a tie!"
Else return "That's not how you play!" for any other input x

I intend on returning to the script to try and write it as a switch statement in the meantime. I also intend on returning to create a webpage and game out of it as opposed to just playing in the console.
